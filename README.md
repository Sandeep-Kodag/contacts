### Serving an Angular project via a development server

```bash
ng serve
```
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

You can configure the default HTTP host and port used by the development server with two command-line options :

```bash
ng serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 4201
```
